It's made with a combination of flour, sugar, milk, salt, yeast or baking powder, and oil for frying. Once prepared, the dough is divided into balls, and each one is then rolled into a thin circle.The disks are dropped in hot oil and fried on both sides until golden. Shelpek is especially significant on Friday, the holiest day of the week in Muslim world, and the flatbread is prepared to honor the memory of the ones that passed away. Once done, these flatbreads are folded, then served with cheese, jam, or sour cream, usually in the afternoon, accompanied by a cup of tea on the side.</p>
