It is probably the most popular dish in the land. The name five fingers is what is required to enjoy it, all five of them.  Typically this dish is made with either horse meat or mutton.  Beef is sometimes used but the others are much more common.  In fact horse meat is so common in Kazakhstan that Olympians had to beg the Olympic committee to allow them to bring it the games so that they could maintain their normal diet. Needless to say, you can certainly enjoy this dish made with beef or lamb and be authentic.  This dish is almost always served on a large platter to be enjoyed by guests on a Darsakstan (either a low table or clear cloth over a rug, on the floor) .  Be sure to use all five fingers, it is a real treat and fun to do.  This is also almost always served with a bowl of the broth on the side called shorpa. Also if you don’t have the time to make the noodles from scratch, you can use lasagna noodles as a fine substitute.  A delicious main dish from Kazakhstan… Enjoy!</p>
